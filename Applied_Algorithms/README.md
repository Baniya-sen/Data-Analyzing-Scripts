# Applied Algorithms

## Description

The Applied Algorithms project folder contains implementations of various algorithms for different tasks. This project demonstrates the use of Python methods and techniques for solving algorithmic problems efficiently.

## Algorithms used:
1. Greedy Algorithm, Implementing Greedy Algorithm, using money change given. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you're dispensing for each customer, lest you run out. Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize the number of coins due.
   
2. Simulate a sports tournament relational possibility of winning chance of a team based on previous scores.

3. Sorting Algorithms, Like Selection sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort applied and timed.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes:
- List manipulation for data processing
- Sorting algorithms for optimization
- Comprehensive algorithms for concise code
