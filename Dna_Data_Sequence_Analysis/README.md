# DNA Data Sequence Analysis

## Description

The DNA Data Sequence Analysis project folder analyzes DNA sequence data to identify patterns and structures. This project demonstrates how Python can be used for biological data analysis and processing.

##Data Set
Provided with Command line arguments- a CSV file with people's DNA STRS count that is unique to each person, and a string of STRS that is extracted from a person's DNA. We can find which DNA string belongs to which person. Using the STR data string, we can find which DNA STR in the longest run has consecutive counts. If the STR 'AGATC' count is 29 in a consecutive run along with other STR's counts, it is unique to each person and is used by many agencies to profile the DNA of criminals and other aspects of medical doctrines.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes:
- List manipulation for data processing and analysis
- File reading for extracting data from text files
- String manipulation for DNA sequence analysis
