# Applied Algorithms

## Description

The Applied Algorithms project folder contains implementations of various algorithms for different tasks. This project demonstrates the use of Python methods and techniques for solving algorithmic problems efficiently.

## Algorithms used:
1. Greedy Algorithm, Implementing Greedy Algorithm, using money change given. When making change, odds are you want to minimize the number of coins you're dispensing for each customer, lest you run out. Fortunately, computer science has given cashiers everywhere ways to minimize the number of coins due.
   
2. Simulate a sports tournament relational possibility of winning chance of a team based on previous scores.

3. Sorting Algorithms, Like Selection sort, Bubble sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort applied and timed.

4. Many Data manipulation, cipher algorithms, credit-checksum, Linked-list inheritance, readability grading, and Vote casting with run-off, etc programs written in C language.
   Compile and run C programs:
   ```C
      gcc -o creditcard_checksum creditcard_checksum.c
      creditcard_checksum

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes:
- `List` manipulation for data processing
- Sorting algorithms for optimization
- Optimized `while` loops in C.
- Comprehensive algorithms for concise code
